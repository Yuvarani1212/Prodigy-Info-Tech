🌟 Featured Projects

TASK -1 : Distribution visualization

Description: This project involves creating a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a specific variable in a dataset.

The objective is to gain insights into the data by understanding the frequency and patterns of the variable's values.

📍Features:

Data collection and preprocessing

Creation of a bar chart for categorical data

Creation of a histogram for continuous data

Customization of visualizations for clarity and aesthetics

Interpretation of the distribution patterns to derive meaningful insights

Technologies: Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

                                                                                   📍Here's a detailed breakdown:

Data Collection: Gather a dataset that includes the variable of interest.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the data to handle missing values and ensure consistent formatting.

📍Distribution Visualization:

For Categorical Variable:

Objective: Visualize the distribution of a categorical variable, such as gender.

Method: Use a bar chart to display the count or frequency of each category.

📍For Continuous Variable:

Objective: Visualize the distribution of a continuous variable, such as age.

Method: Use a histogram to display the frequency distribution of different values.

📍Customization and Interpretation:

Customize the visualizations by adding titles, labels, and adjusting aesthetics for better readability.

Interpret the visualizations to understand the distribution patterns and derive insights, 

such as identifying common categories in a bar chart or typical value ranges in a histogram.

TASK-2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

Description: This project involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from chatgpt.

The goal is to preprocess the data, explore relationships between variables, and identify patterns and trends that could provide insights into the factors influencing survival rates on the Titanic.

Features:

Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values in columns such as age, cabin, and embarked.

For instance, missing ages might be filled with the median age, while missing embarkation points could be filled with the most frequent value.

Converting categorical variables (like gender and embarkation port) into numerical formats for analysis.

Detecting and addressing outliers that could skew the analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understanding the distribution of key variables such as age, fare, and class.

Exploring relationships between different variables:

Age and Survival Rate: Analyzing if younger passengers had a higher survival rate compared to older passengers.

Class and Survival Rate: Investigating if passengers in higher classes (first class) had better chances of survival compared to those in lower classes (third class).

Sex and Survival Rate: Examining the survival rate differences between male and female passengers.

Visualizing the data using various types of plots:

Histograms: To show the distribution of continuous variables like age and fare.

Bar Charts: To depict the survival rates by class and gender.

Box Plots: To identify the spread and potential outliers in fare prices across different classes.

Scatter Plots: To explore the relationship between age and fare, and how they relate to survival.

Statistical Analysis:

Conducting statistical tests to determine if the observed relationships between variables are significant.

This helps in confirming whether factors like age, class, and sex significantly influenced survival rates.

Using correlation analysis to identify the strength and direction of relationships between variables. 

For instance, checking if there's a strong negative correlation between class and survival rate.
summary of Findings:
Summarizing the key insights derived from the EDA. This includes highlighting the significant factors influencing survival rates and presenting the findings through well-designed visualizations.
For example, one might find that women and children had higher survival rates, and that passengers in first class had better chances of survival compared to those in third class.
